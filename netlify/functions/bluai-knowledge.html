I. Detailed Shipping and Order Fulfillment

Title: Detailed Shipping and Order Fulfillment

We fulfill Nigerian orders within 3 to 5 business days, as all items are made-to-order. We currently do not offer international shipping or delivery outside of Nigeria. Once your item is ready, we will contact you to confirm your preferred courier or a local pickup arrangement within Nigeria. Delivery costs are separate from the item price and will be communicated once your order is ready; you pay the courier directly. Customers may choose their own preferred courier. For customers located in Lagos, a local pickup option is available at no extra cost; pickup details are shared once the order is ready. This approach ensures your personalized items arrive on time and in perfect condition.

Pricing, Payment, and Ordering Process

Title: Pricing, Payment, and Ordering Process Details

All prices listed on our website are in Nigerian Naira (₦). We currently accept payment exclusively through bank transfers. Payment details necessary for the transfer are shared with you after your order has been confirmed via email. Receiving an order confirmation email means we have received your order and are preparing to process it, but it does not yet constitute order acceptance. If you have shipping inquiries, please contact us via our Contact Form, WhatsApp, Call, SMS at +234 708 005 4074, or Email at hello@iamxis.com.ng.

Terms, Returns, and Liability Details

Title: Detailed Terms, Returns, and Liability

Our policy is that all sales of non-damaged products are final and non-refundable; returns are only accepted if the product arrives damaged. If the product is damaged upon arrival, you must reach out to us within 7 days of delivery and may be asked to fill out a return form at https://iamxis.com.ng/return-form/. Refunds are processed only after the returned damaged item has been received and checked by our team. If an exchange requires a second delivery, the customer is responsible for covering the additional delivery cost. All content, trademarks, and logos on the website are protected by I AM XIS intellectual property. These terms of purchase are governed exclusively by Nigerian law, and disputes are handled by Nigerian courts.

IV. Personalization and Design File Requirements

Title: Personalization and Design File Requirements

We accept high-resolution files in PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG, or PDF format. Every detail matters, so files must be clear, high-quality, and not blurry. We use a standard CMYK color profile. For the best print results, files should have a minimum of 300 DPI. Avoid screenshots or small, pixelated images. If sending designs via WhatsApp, please send the file as a document, not a photo, to maintain full quality.

You must select your preferred print size before uploading your design. For Tees, sizes range from A5 Mini (5" x 8") to A2 Max (16" x 23"). For Totes, the print size is A4 Mid (8" x 11"). You can upload at least three files per order, with each file under 10MB.

If you have a specific design placement (front, center, corner), please let us know by adding a note during checkout or uploading a reference image. Clear file naming (e.g., "front tote image.png") is essential for accurate placement. Once an order is placed and the design file is confirmed, changes cannot be made after a strict 6-hour window, as our production process begins shortly thereafter. We cannot guarantee exact color matches due to variations in monitor settings and material absorption rates. If you are unsure about your file quality, please reach out to us for assistance via our Contact Form, WhatsApp, Call, SMS at +234 708 005 4074, or Email at hello@iamxis.com.ng.

III. Product Care and Durability

Title: Care Instructions and Product Durability

All of our prints are crisp, durable, and made to last with proper care. Our personalized Tees are made from 100% breathable cotton and should be washed inside out in cold water and hung dry. Avoid using bleach and do not iron directly over the custom print. Totes are crafted from 100% durable cotton and should be spot-cleaned gently with mild detergent and a soft cloth. Avoid machine washing or scrubbing totes. Both Glossy Mugs and Magic Mugs are high-quality, but for maximum print longevity, we recommend hand washing them with warm water and mild soap. Avoid using dishwashers for mugs.

Totes are designed for everyday carry; select totes include a lined interior with pockets for added functionality.

We offer custom made options which can be viewed in our Custom Made Edit section here - https://iamxis.com.ng/collections/custom-made/. For any special requests related to custom orders, please reach out to our support team directly.
